<p>
Especially if you are planning to attend NAACL first, staying in Seattle in a hotel near the NAACL venue might be the best option. From there you have the 545 express bus (Stop on Olive way) to Redmond which stops near the Microsoft Campus (OTC = Overlake Transit Center). Outside rush hour that bus takes about 25 minutes and leaves every 10 to 15 minutes. It's similarly convenient for the way back. That area has reasonably good dining options either in Downtown, Belltown, South Lake Union or Capitol Hill, all in walking distance. It's also easier to make the trip from and to Redmond during the day than making your way back to Redmond from Seattle in the late evening or in the night. The area around the Microsoft Campus itself is a bit "suburban". Take this into account.
